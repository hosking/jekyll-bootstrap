I am a professor of computer science, with academic appointments at [Purdue
University](http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/hosking) and the [Australian
National University](http://cs.anu.edu.au/user/3893).  I studied computer
science at the [University of Adelaide](http://cs.adelaide.edu.au), the
[University of Waikato](http://cs.waikato.ac.nz), and the [University of
Massachusetts at Ahmerst](www.cs.umass.edu), receiving BSc, MSc, and PhD
degrees, respectively.  My research interests lie in the area of programming
language implementation, and I work on problems arising in object persistence,
object databases, distribution, memory management (*garbage collection*),
managed language runtimes, language virtual machines, optimizing compilers,
and architectural support for programming languages and applications.

I am a Life Member of the Association for Computing Machinery, and was named a
Distinguished Scientist of the ACM in 2012.

I am co-author of the primary reference work for automatic memory management
[*The Garbage Collection Handbook*](http://gchandbook.org).
